Demo using standard library custom functions findall(), rotate()

Custom function that finds all occurrences of a container of blocks of byes (const) beginning with the same byte as the search pattern.
Example: If I search "Dolphin" in a block of zero-terminated strings, I will get all occurrences beginning with 'D', like "Delta", "Doris", "Darie" etc.

Pre-development version - not quite pre-alpha; 
TODO: Comment and document, solve issues, performance test and check, make available for other project as (include only?) library
